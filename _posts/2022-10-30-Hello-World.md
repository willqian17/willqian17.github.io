How would modern day tasks hold up against the technologies of the past? Or, is it the other way around?

Following the 2020 Pandemic, schools and workplaces transitioned to a fully digital setting, relying 100% on technology to recreate workplace and classroom environments. Modern society has become increasingly dependent on technology for communication and productivity. Being tasked with sacrificing some of these components would be a major challenge. No, I did not succeed.

For this assignment, I chose to work with the technologies of 1992. I figured this would be a more realistic option which would challenge me to limit screentime and digital technology while still allowing me to go about my day “normally.” Before diving into 1992, I thought about what the toughest challenges would be without access to texting, web browsing, and using my phone for anything other than calling. Video games and streaming services would be an easy sacrifice for just a day, as I’ve already gone days without either in the past weeks, but my phone has become such an integral part of my life that going without it became a huge struggle.
	
As the day went on, I started feeling stressed. All of my course information and assignments are posted online, and all of my academic resources are found digitally. Of course, there are alternatives. Physical textbooks can be purchased, and documents can be printed, but I hadn’t purchased physical textbooks and many of my courses online resources aren’t designed to be done in a physical environment. Some assignments could’ve been printed out ahead of time, but of course, I didn’t do that. The lack of modern technology prevented me from checking assignments, due dates, course information, and any separate online resources. Given all of these inconveniences, it was definitely easier to take a day off from school assignments, but not having access to my classes was fairly stressful. Even two years removed from the initial impact from the Covid-19 Pandemic, our education still tends to rely heavily on digital infrastructure and not having access to it was very stress inducing given our limited alternatives.

What does the average person do on a day off? While I was still able to bike around Boston, sitting at home was more boring than usual. Although I don’t play video games as often, streaming services such as YouTube or Spotify have become applications which I use daily. They aren’t typically used actively but serve as entertainment or background noise during other tasks such as homework or cooking. I found myself tuning my bicycle and playing around with electronics, but the sound of music wouldn’t be passing through my ears this time. It certainly felt a lot quieter, almost empty. A reliable way to pass time may involve conversing and spending time with friends and family. However, talking to people wouldn’t be as easy as it was less than 12 hours prior.

Communication was my failure point.  This seemed odd to me at first, given that the available technology in 1992 actually allowed for phone calls. However, the network of communication established in recent years has become such a convenience that contacting others through methods other than texting almost seem ancient. During this 24-hour period, I was unable to contact larger groups. Phone calls could only reach one person at a time, which meant that relaying messages to project groups, friend groups, or teams was much more difficult. Phoning home was still the same as usual but connecting with those around me was much harder than I expected. Mailing a letter was just unreasonable, and we simply don’t go knocking on each other’s doors like we used to. I eventually gave up and joined a group call on Discord and replied to multiple teams, but prior to this my day had been feeling pretty lonely. I’m a fairly anti-social person, but I was almost amazed by how disconnected I felt after less than a day of ignoring online messaging. Oddly enough, it felt like I should’ve been stressed, but for some reason I wasn’t.

Before heading into this, I was already well aware that the reliance on modern technologies in modern times is pretty heavy. But I didn’t realize just how much I depended on it on a day-to-day basis and how it felt when all of it was gone. Two of the obvious components were how digital media influenced the way we communicate and our entertainment, but I was most surprised by just how much digital media has become integrated into our educational structure. I can only imagine that this branches into thousands of roles in our modern workforce, but this dependence was realized by how stressed I felt after being disconnected from the web. To say that everything (in regard to our education) has moved to a digital platform really wouldn’t be an exaggeration. 

As someone who really doesn’t have any major presence on social media, I can’t draw any conclusions on what kind of impact social media sites such as Instagram or Snapchat has on the modern age. Aside from that, the way we communicate and the way our careers are shaped have certainly seen an increase in dependence on digital media and spending a day attempting to “live in 1992” definitely confirms my initial predictions and more. Digital technology is almost more than an integral part of our daily lives – in some cases, our lives and schedules revolve around it. Between education, entertainment, and communication, digital media has become the normal medium for all of these components in our lives.
